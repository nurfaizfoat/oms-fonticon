# SupaOMS Font Icon

A set of font icon for SupaOMS

## Getting Started

Open *demo.html* to see a list of all the glyphs in your font along with their codes.

To use the generated font in desktop programs, you can install the TTF font. While, to use it in your own web project, you may look at how *style.css* is written.

In order to copy the character associated with each icon, refer to the text box at the bottom right corner of each glyph in *demo.html*. The character inside this text box may be invisible; but it can still be copied. See this guide for more info: https://icomoon.io/#docs/font-face

You won't need any of the files located under the *demo-files* directory when including the generated font in your own projects. 

## Built With

* [Icomoon App](https://icomoon.io/) - The web framework to create custom font icon for your project.
